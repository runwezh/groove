It was <span class=emphasis>the most life-changing moment</span> I ever had… like, did I hear that? It sounded like the kick drum was played by a drunk 3-year old, and i was like ‘Are you allowed to do that?’” ~Questlove","classname":"quote","sound":"drunk"},{"text":"The drums are, in many ways, the backbone of the band. They provide a steady beat for the other musicians to follow. Up until this point, Questlove, like many drummers, had essentially trained to be a metronome, keeping perfect time.","sound":"normal"},{"text":"But what he heard that night was the opposite of perfect - some notes hit slightly sooner than expected or slightly later. The whole thing was unbalanced, off-kilter, unexpected. And it was… awesome.","sound":"drunk"},{"text":"“I’d never heard someone not give a f***, and that to me was <span class=emphasis>the most liberating</span> moment. like, all this pleasing my father, being perfect… Now I've got to undo all the education and all the hours of preparation that I did.” ~Questlove","classname":"quote"},{"text":"The beat Questlove was hearing was made by JDilla, a producer who pioneered an all-new way to think about rhythm that influences musicians to this day.
