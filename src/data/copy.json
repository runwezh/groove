They provide a steady beat for the other musicians to follow. Up until this point, Questlove, like many drummers, had essentially trained to be a metronome, keeping perfect time."},{"text":"But what he heard that night was the opposite of perfect - some notes hit slightly sooner than expected, others slightly later. The whole thing was messy, imperfect, uneven. And it was… awesome."},{"text":"“I’d just never heard someone not give a fuck, and that to me was the most liberating moment.

Although he only lived to 32 and never had a mainstream hit, he is now considered one of the most influential producers in hip hop and popular music. The songs he produced reshaped our understanding of rhythm and time, and their influence persists among many musicians today."},{"text":"At first glance, it might look like chaos, but beneath the surface lies a meticulously crafted rhythmic sensibility.

Let’s get in the weeds.","chunks":[{"type":"p","text":"Swing is defined by delaying that second note, but by how much exactly? The swing examples you just heard are called <strong>triplet swing</strong> because if we divide each beat in 3 parts (called triplets), the groove can be felt as the first and third of those triplets. Ordinarily, the beat would be divided into an even number of parts, and we could play two evenly spaced notes. Dividing the beat into an odd number of parts always results in an uneven feeling, since one note must be slightly longer than the other."},{"type":"div","component":"Image","src":"static_swing.png","alt":"Diagram showing different ways of dividing a beat to create different levels of swing.

A rotation around this circle represents 1 beat. For a triplet swing, the beat is divided in 3 parts, and notes are played on the first and third, which is as close to even as we can get. Another way you can describe this rhythm is to say it has a 66.6% <strong>swing percentage</strong>, meaning that the first note takes up 66.6% of the beat.

These grooves have a unique funkiness - caught between a swung and straight feel, they have a lilting, off-kilter feeling.
