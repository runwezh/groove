Sometimes you were a little late or a little early. To correct this, we can snap every note to the nearest steady beat. This is called quantizing, and most music recording software lets you do this with the click of a button."},{"type":"p","text":"Now listen to this clip of “Sincerity is Scary” by The 1975.

Some hits come slightly early, others slightly late. It’s the rhythmic equivalent of coloring a little outside of the lines or playing slightly out of tune."},{"type":"p","text":"But at the same time... it’s groovy. It’s chill, laid back, off-kilter, sort of like you’re falling but never quite catching yourself."},{"type":"p","text":"These are professional musicians - they know what they’re doing, and there’s intention behind it. They’re following in the tradition of artists like J Dilla, who pioneered this style of playing off the grid, which went against what musicians are typically taught, to play perfectly evenly."},{"type":"div","component":"Quote","props":{"quote":"“It was the most life-changing moment I ever had… it sounded like the kick drum was played by a drunk 3 year old.

I want to focus on the timefeel that Dilla pioneered. How does it work? What does it look and sound like? The book was great, but I wanted visuals I could interact with."}]},{"id":"straight","title":"🥁 part i: straight","chunks":[{"type":"p","text":"The quantized beat you made is described as rhythmically “straight.” This means that the notes line up with our typical evenly spaced grid.

Once a pattern is established it sets up an expectation. We expect to hear an event in a positive (or “strong”) space, and do not expect to hear one in a negative (or “weak”) space.","speaker":"Dan Charnas (Dilla Time)"}},{"type":"div","component":"Quote","props":{"quote":"Our expectations are governed by the most granular pulse in a given song, what we call the rhythmic current. In hip-hop, we expect to hear a beat counted in fours. Usually the hi-hat acts as the metronome, and because it hits two times for every one of those four beats, it sets the rhythmic current at eight.","speaker":"Dan Charnas (Dilla Time)"}},{"type":"div","component":"Quote","props":{"quote":"“Because the rhythmic current - the most granular pulse - governs our expectations, changes on a microscopic level can ironically be jarring, and it is in this area, subverting the rhythmic current that [J Dilla] did most of his work. In a typical J Dilla beat, the rushed snare messes with our expectations by falling into a weak area of the rhythmic current and not a strong one.","speaker":"Dan Charnas (Dilla Time)"}}]}]}
