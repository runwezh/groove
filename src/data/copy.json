He was in the car leaving the venue when he heard a beat coming from inside that sounded… wrong."},{"text":"“As I’m leaving the club, I'm hearing the vibration of the kick drum. it was the most life-changing moment I ever had… like, did I hear that? it sounded like the kick drum was played by a drunk 3-year old, and i was like ‘are you allowed to do that?’” -Questlove","sound":"drunk"},{"text":"The drums are, in many ways, the backbone of the band. They provide a steady beat for the other musicians to follow. Up until this point, Questlove, like many drummers, had essentially trained to be a metronome, keeping perfect time.","sound":"normal","showNotes":"true"},{"text":"But what he heard that night was the opposite of perfect - some notes hit slightly sooner than expected or slightly later. The whole thing was unbalanced, off-kilter, unexpected. And it was… awesome.","sound":"drunk","showNotes":"true"},{"text":"“I’d never heard someone not give a fuck, and that to me was the most liberating moment. like, all this pleasing my father, being perfect… Now I've got to undo all the education and all the hours of preparation that I did.” -Questlove"},{"text":"The beat Questlove was hearing was made by JDilla, a producer who pioneered an all-new way to think about rhythm that influences musicians to this day.

You hear a note, a space, then another note, and that distance stays the same. It’s the way Questlove had trained so hard to play."},{"type":"p","text":"Here are some songs with straight grooves. How do they feel to you? To me it feels: precise, even, tight."}]}]}
